<h2>Recent News</h2>

<a name="2013_05_20"></a><h3>2013-05-20 - Release 3.7.17</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_17.html">version 3.7.17</a> is a regularly schedule maintenance release.
  Visit the <a href="releaselog/3_7_17.html">change log</a> for a full explanation of the
  changes in this release.</p>

<p>  There are many bug fixes in version 3.7.17.  But this does not indicate
  that 3.7.16 was a problematic release.  All of the bugs in 3.7.17 are 
  obscure and are unlikely to impact any particular application.  And most 
  of the bugs that are fixed in 3.7.17 predate 3.7.16 and have been in 
  the code for years without ever before being noticed.
  Nevertheless, due to the large number of fixes,
  all users are encouraged to upgrade when possible.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_04_12"></a><h3>2013-04-12 - Release 3.7.16.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_16_2.html">version 3.7.16.2</a> fixes a long-standing flaw in the Windows
  OS interface that
  can result in database corruption under a rare race condition.
  See <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f">http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f</a> for a full description
  of the problem.</p>

<p>  As far as we know, this bug has never been seen in the wild.  The
  problem was discovered by the SQLite developers while writing stress tests
  for a separate component of SQLite.  Those stress tests have not yet
  found any problems with the component they were intended to verify, but 
  they did find the bug which is the subject of this patch release.</p>

<p>  Other than updates to version numbers, the only difference between this
  release and 3.7.16.1 is a two-character change in a single identifier,
  which is contained in the windows-specific OS interface logic.  There 
  are no changes in this release (other than version numbers) for platforms
  other than Windows.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_03_29"></a><h3>2013-03-29 - Release 3.7.16.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_16_1.html">version 3.7.16.1</a> is a bug fix release that fixes a few problems
  that were present in the previous releases.</p>

<p>  The primary motivation for version 3.7.16.1 is to fix a bug in the
  query optimizer that was introduced as part of <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The
  query optimizer was being a little overzealous in optimizing out some
  ORDER BY clauses, which resulted in sorting being omitted on occasions
  where sorting is required to get the correct answer.  See
  ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a179fe7465">a179fe7465</a> for
  details.</p>

<p>  In addition to the ORDER BY fix, several other patches to fix obscure
  (and mostly harmless) bugs and to fix spelling errors in source code
  comments are also included in this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_03_18"></a><h3>2013-03-18 - Release 3.7.16</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_16.html">version 3.7.16</a> is a regularly scheduled release of SQLite.
  This release contains several langauge enhancements and improvements
  to the query optimizer.  A list of the major enhancements and optimizations
  can be see on the <a href="releaselog/3_7_16.html">change log</a>.</p>

<p>  There was one important bug fix
  (see <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/fc7bd6358f">Ticket fc7bd6358f</a>)
  that addresses an incorrect query result that could have occurred in
  a three-way join where the join constraints compared INTEGER columns
  to TEXT columns.  This issue had been in the code for time out of mind
  and had never before been reported, so we surmise that it is very obscure.
  Nevertheless, all users are advised to upgrade to avoid any future problems
  associated with this issue.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_01_09"></a><h3>2013-01-09 - Release 3.7.15.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_2.html">version 3.7.15.2</a> is a patch release that fixes a single bug
  that was introduced in version <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The fix is a 4-character
  edit to a single line of code.  Other than this 4-character change and
  the update of the version number, nothing has changed from
  <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_1.html">version 3.7.15.1</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_12_19"></a><h3>2012-12-19 - Release 3.7.15.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15_1.html">version 3.7.15.1</a> is a patch release that fixes a single bug
  that was introduced in version <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The fix involved changing
  two lines of code and adding a single assert().  This release also includes
  some new test cases to prevent a regression of the bug, and the version
  number is increased, of course.  But otherwise, nothing has changed from
  <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_12_12"></a><h3>2012-12-12 - Release 3.7.15</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a> is a regularly schedule release of SQLite.  This
  release contains several improvements to the query planner and optimizer
  and one important bug fix.  This is the first release to officially
  support Windows 8 Phone.</p>

<p>  The important bug fix is a problem that can lead to segfaults when using
  <a href="sharedcache.html">shared cache mode</a> on a schema that contains a <a href="lang_expr.html#collateop">COLLATE operator</a> within
  a <a href="lang_createtable.html#ckconst">CHECK constraint</a> or within a <a href="lang_createview.html">view</a>.  Collating functions are associated
  with individual database connections.  But a pointer to the collating function
  was also being cached within expressions.  If an expression was part of the
  schema and contained a cached collating function, it would point to the
  collating function in the database connection that originally parsed the
  schema.  If that database connection closed while other database 
  connections using the same shared cache continued to operate, they other
  database connections would try to use the deallocated collating function
  in the database connection that closed.  The fix in version 3.7.15 was to
  not cache collating function pointers in the expression structure but 
  instead look them up each time a new statement is prepared.</p>

<p>  This release also contains some important enhancements to the query planner
  which should (we hope) make some queries run faster.  The enhancements
  include:</p>

<p>  <ol><li><p>When doing a full-table scan, try to use an index instead of
  the original table, under the theory that indices contain less information
  and are thus smaller and hence require less disk I/O to scan.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Enhance the <a href="lang_expr.html#in_op">IN operator</a> to allow it to make use of 
  indices that have <a href="datatype3.html#affinity">numeric affinity</a>.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Do a better job of recognizing when an ORDER BY clause can be 
  implemented using indices - especially in cases where the ORDER BY clause
  contains terms from two or more tables in a join.</p>
  </ol>
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_10_04"></a><h3>2012-10-04 - Release 3.7.14.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14_1.html">version 3.7.14.1</a> is a patch release.  Changes from the baseline
  version 3.7.14 are minimal and are restricted to fixing three bugs.</p>

<p>  One of the fixed bugs is a long-standing issue with the TCL interface.
  Another is an external compiler bug that SQLite merely works around and
  that only comes up if you are using the VisualStudio-2012 compiler to
  generate WinRT applications on ARM with optimizations enabled.  The
  third problem is an SQLite core bug, introduced in version 3.7.14, that
  can cause a segfault if a query contains a LEFT JOIN that contains an OR
  in the ON clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_09_03"></a><h3>2012-09-03 - Release 3.7.14</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14.html">version 3.7.14</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
  of SQLite.  The previous release continues to work well.  Upgrading
  is optional.</p>

<p>  Version 3.7.14 drops native support for OS/2.  We are not aware of any
  active projects that were using SQLite on OS/2 and since the SQLite
  developers had no way of testing on OS/2 it seemed like it was time
  to simply remove the OS/2 code from the SQLite tree.  If there are
  OS/2 projects out there that still need SQLite support, they can
  continue to maintain their own private <a href="vfs.html">VFS</a> which can be linked to
  SQLite at start-time using the <a href="c3ref/vfs_find.html">sqlite3_vfs_register()</a> interface.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/close.html">sqlite3_close_v2()</a> interface has been added.  The sqlite3_close_v2()
  interface differs from sqlite3_close() in that it is designed to work
  better for host language that use a garbage collector.  With the older
  sqlite3_close() interface, the associated <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statements</a> and
  <a href="c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> objects must be destroyed before the database connection.
  With the newer sqlite3_close_v2() interface, the objects can be destroyed
  in any order.</p>

<p>  This release also includes performance improvements to the sort algorithm
  that is used to implement ORDER BY and CREATE INDEX.  And the query planner
  has been enhanced to better use covering indices on queries that use OR
  terms in the WHERE clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_06_11"></a><h3>2012-06-11 - Release 3.7.13</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_13.html">version 3.7.13</a> adds support for WinRT and metro style
  applications for Microsoft Windows 8.  The 3.7.13 release is
  coming sooner than is usual after the previous release in order to get
  this new capability into the hands of developers.  To use SQLite in 
  a metro style application, compile with the -DSQLITE_OS_WINRT flag.
  Because of the increased application security and safety requirements
  of WinRT, all database
  filenames should be full pathnames.  Note that SQLite is not capable
  of accessing databases outside the installation directory and application
  data directory.  This restriction is another security and safety feature
  of WinRT. Apart from these restrictions, SQLite should work exactly
  the same on WinRT as it does on every other system.</p>

<p>  Also in this release: when a database is opened using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>
  and the <a href="uri.html#coreqp">mode=memory</a> query parameter 
  then the database is an in-memory database, just as if it had
  been named ":memory:".  But, if shared cache mode is enabled, then
  all other database connections that specify the same URI filename
  will connect to the same in-memory database.  This allows two or more
  database connections (in the same process) to share the same in-memory
  database.</p>

<p>  This release also includes some corner-case performance optimizations
  that are obscure yet significant to an important subset of SQLite users.
  Getting these performance optimizations into circulation quickly is
  yet another reason for making this release so soon following the previous.</p>

<p>  The next release of SQLite is scheduled to occur after the usual
  2 or 3 month interval.
